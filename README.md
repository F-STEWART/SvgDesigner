# SvgDesigner
## An app that allows the user to design svg files from basic shapes

The app allows the user to click and drag ellipses, rectangles and triangles of various colours to create vector art.
Unfinished vector art projects can be saved to a json text file and later loaded.
The main view allows the user to view the image they are creating as they edit it. 
The last created shape can always be removed with the "undo" feature.

This project uses the svg.net and newtonsoft json libraries. Inspiration taken from Christopher Diggins' code examples for the class.
